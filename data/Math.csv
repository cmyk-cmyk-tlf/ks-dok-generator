Math	7	7.SP.3	Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the difference between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of variability (requires introduction of mean absolute deviation).

(NOTE: Students should not have to calculate mean absolute deviation but use it to interpret data).
Math	7	7.SP.5	Express the probability of a chance event as a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood of the event occurring. (Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a probability around indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.)
Math	7	7.SP.6	Collect data from a chance process (probability experiment). Approximate the probability by observing its long-run relative frequency. Recognize that as the number of trials increase, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability. Conversely, predict the approximate relative frequency given the probability.

Math	8	8.EE.3	Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other.

Math	8	8.NS.1	Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number.
Math	8	8.NS.2	Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g. ). For example, for the approximation of , show that is between 8 and 9 and closer to 8.

Math	8	8.SP.3	Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept.
