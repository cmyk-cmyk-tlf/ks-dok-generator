What happens when there is no light?  What are some ways plants and animals meet their needs so that they can survive and grow?  How are parents and their children similar and different?  What objects are in the sky and how do they seem to move?‚Äù First grade performance expectations include PS4 , LS1, LS3, and ESS1 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework . Students are expected to develop understanding of the relationship between sound and vibrating materials as well as between the availability of light and ability to see objects. The idea that light travels from place to place can be understood by students at this level through determining the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of light.  Students are also expected to develop understanding of how pl ants and animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs as well as how behaviors of parents and offspring help the offspring survive.  The understanding  is developed that young plants and animals are lik e, but not exactly the same a s, their parents.  Students are able to observe, describe, and predict some patterns of the movement of objects in the sky. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; structure and function ; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disc iplinary core ideas. In the first grade  performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade -appropriate proficiency in planning and carrying o ut investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, and obtaining , evaluating , and communicating information .

How can the impact of weather-related hazards be reduced? How do organisms vary in their traits? How are plants, animals, and environments of the past similar or different from current plants, animals, and environments? What happens to organisms when their environment changes? How do equal and unequal forces on an object affect the object? How can magnets be used?‚Äù Third grade performance expectations include PS2, LS1, LS2, LS3, LS4, ESS2, and ESS3 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework . Students are able to organize and use data to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season. By applying their understanding of weather-related hazards, students are able to make a claim about the merit of a design solution that reduces the impacts of such hazards. Students are expected to develop an understanding of the s imilarities and differences of organisms‚Äô life cycles. An understanding that organisms have different inherited traits, and that the environment can also affect the traits that an organism develops, is acquired by students at this level. In addition, students are able to construct an explanation using evidence for how the variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing. Students are expected to develop an understanding of types of organisms that lived long ago and also about the nature of their environments. Third graders are expected to develop an understanding of the idea that when the environment changes some organisms survive and reproduce, some move to new locations, some move into the transformed environment, and some die. Students are able to determine the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object and the cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each other. They are then able to apply their understanding of magnetic interactions to define a simple design problem that can be solved with magnets. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the third grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in asking questions and defining problems; developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc.

Science	3	3-PS2-1	Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of  the effect s of balanced and unbalanced forces on  the motion of  an object.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples could include an unbalanced force on one side of a ball can make it start moving ; and, balanced forces pushing on a box from both sides will not produce any  motion at all.]  [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to one variable at a time: number, size, or direction of forces . Assessment does not include quantitative  force size , only qualitative and relative. Assessment  is limited to gravity  being addres sed as a force that pulls objects down.]
Science	3	3-PS2-2	Make observations  and/or measurements of an object‚Äôs  motion to provide evidence that a pattern  can be used to predict f uture  motion .  [Clarification Statement:  Example s of motion with a predictable pattern  could include  a child swinging in a swing, a ball rolling back and forth in a bowl, and two children on a see -saw.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include t echnical terms such as period and frequency.]
Science	3	3-PS2-3	Ask questions to determine cause and effe ct relationships  of electric or  magnetic interactions between  two objects not in contact with each other .  [Clarification  Statement:  Examples of an electric force could include the force on hair from an electrically charged balloon and the electrical forces between a charged rod and pieces of paper; examples of a magnetic force could include the force between two permanent magnets, the force between an electromagnet and steel paperclips, and the force exerted by one magnet versus the fo rce exerted by two magnets. Examples of cause and effect relationships could include how the distance between objects affects strength of the force and how the orientation of magnets affects the directi on of the magnetic force.] [Assessment  Boundary:  Assessment is l imited to forces produced by objects that can be manipulated by students , and e lectrical interactions are limited to static electricity.]
Science	3	3-PS2-4	Define a simple design problem that can  be solved by applying scientific ideas about magnets. *  [Clarification Statement: Examples of problems could include constructing a latch to keep a door shut  and creating a device to keep two moving objects from touching each other .] The performance expectations above were developed using the following elemen ts from the NRC document  A Framework for K -12 Science Education : Science and Engineering Practice s Asking Questions and Defining Problems Asking questions and defining problems in grades 3 ‚Äì5 builds on grades K ‚Äì2 experiences and progresses to specifying qualitative relationships.

(3 -PS2-1) Disciplinary Core Ideas PS2.A:  Forces and Motion ÔÇß Each force acts on one particular object and has both strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has multiple forces acting on it, but they add to give zero net force on the object. Forces that do not sum to zero can cause changes in t he object‚Äôs speed or direction of motion. (Boundary: Qualitative and conceptual, but not quantitative addition of forces  are used at this level.) (3-PS2-1) ÔÇß The patterns of an object‚Äôs motion in various situations can be observed and measured; when that pas t motion exhibits a regular pattern, future motion can be predicted from it. (Boundary: Technical terms, such as magnitude, velocity, momentum, and vector quantity, are not introduced at this level, but the concept that some quantities need both size and d irection to be described is developed.) ( 3-PS2-2) PS2.B:  Types o f Interactions ÔÇß Objects in contact exert forces on each other . (3-PS2-1) ÔÇß Electric , and magnetic forces between a pair of objects do not require that the objects be in contact. The sizes of the forces in each situation depend on the properties of the objects and their distances apart and, for forces between two magnets, on their orientation relative to each other. ( 3-PS2-3),(3-PS2-4) Crosscutting Concepts Patterns ÔÇß Patterns of change can be used to make predictions. ( 3-PS2-2) Cause and Effect ÔÇß Cause and effect relationships are routinely identified.

How can water, ice, wind and vegetation change the land? What patterns of Earth‚Äôs features can be determined with the use of maps? How do internal and external structures support the survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction of plants and animals? What is energy and how is it related to motion? How is energy transferred? How can energy be used to solve a problem?‚Äù Fourth grade performance expectations include PS3, PS4, LS1, ESS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework . Students are able to use a model of waves to describe patterns of waves in terms of amplitude and wavelength, and that waves can cause objects to move. Students are expected to develop understanding of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation. They apply their knowledge of natural Earth processes to generate and compare multiple solutions to reduce the impacts of such processes on humans. In order to describe patterns of Earth‚Äôs features, s tudents analyze and interpret data from maps. Fourth graders are expected to develop an understanding that plants and animals have internal and external structures that function to support survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction. By developing a model, they describe that an object can be seen when light reflected from its surface enters the eye. Students are able to use evidence to construct an explanation of t he relationship between the speed of an object and the energy of that object. Students are expected to develop an understanding that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electric currents or from object to object through collisions. They apply their understanding of energy to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another . The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter; systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fourth grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in asking questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information.

How much water can be found in different places on Earth? Can new substances be created by combining other substances? How does matter cycle through ecosystems? Where does the energy in food come from and what is it used for? How do lengths and directions of shadows or relative lengths of day and night change from day to day, and how does the appearance of some stars change in different seasons ?‚Äù Fifth grade performance expectations include PS1, PS2, PS3, LS1, LS2, ESS1, ESS2, and ESS3 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework . Students are able to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen through the development of a model . Students develop an understanding of the idea that regardless of the type of change that matter undergoes, the total weight of matter is conserved. Students determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.   Through the development of a model using an example, students are able to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.  They describe and graph data to provide evidence about the distribution of water on Earth. Students develop an understanding of the idea that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water. Using models, students can describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment and that energy in animals‚Äô food was once energy from the sun. Students are expected to develop an understanding of patterns of daily changes in length and direction of shadows, day and night, and the seasonal appearance of some stars in the night sky. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; energy and matter; and systems and systems models are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fifth grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematics and computational thinking, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

(5-LS2-1) Disciplinary Core Ideas LS2.A:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems ÔÇß The food of almost any kind of animal can be traced back to plants. Organisms are related in food webs in which some animals eat plants for food and other animals eat the animals that eat plants . Some organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms (both plants or plants parts and animals) and therefore operate as ‚Äúdecomposers.‚Äù Decomposition eventually restores (recycles) some materials back to the soil. Organisms can survive on ly in environments in which their particular needs a re met. A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life. Newly introduced species can damage the balance of an ecosystem. ( 5-LS2-1) LS2.B:  Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems ÔÇß Matter cycles between the air and soil and among plants, animals, and microbes as these organisms live and die.

All rights reserved. 46 of 103 Middle School Physical  Science Students in middle school continue to develop understanding of four core ideas in  the physical science s. The middle school performance expectations in  the Physical Science s build on the K ‚Äì 5 ideas and capabilities  to allow learners to explain phenomena central to the physical science s but also to the life sciences and earth and space science. The performance expectations in physical science blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscuttin g concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge to explain real world phenomena in the physical, biological, and earth and space sciences . In the physical science s, performance expectations at the middle school level focus on students develo ping understanding of several scientific practices. These include developing and using models, planning and conducting investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical and computational thinking, and constructing explanations; and to use  these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate understanding of several of engineering practices including design and evaluation. The performance expectations in PS1: Matter and its Interactions  help students to formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúHow do atomic and molecular interactions explain the properties of matter that we see and feel? ‚Äù by building understanding of what occurs at the atomic and molecular scale.  In middle school , the PS1 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into two sub-ideas:   the structure and properties of matter , and chemical reactions.  By the end of middle school , students will be able to apply understanding that pure substances have characteristic physical and chemical properties and are made from a single type of atom or molecule. They will be able to provide molecular level accounts to explain states of matters and changes between states , that chemical reactions involve regroup ing of atoms to form new substances , and that atoms rearrange during chemical reactions. Students are also able to apply an understanding of the design and the process of optimization in engineering to chemical reaction systems. The crosscutting concepts o f patterns ; cause and effect ; scale, proportion and quantity ; energy and matter ; structure and function ; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and influence of science, engineering and technology on society and the natural world  are call ed out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS1 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data, designing solutions,  and obtaining, eval uating, and communicating information. Students use these scientific and engineering practices to demonstrate understanding of the disciplinary core ideas. The performance expectations in PS2: Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions focuses on helping students understand ideas related to why some objects will keep moving, why objects fall to the ground and why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not.  Students answer the question , ‚ÄúHow can one describe physica l interactions between objects  and within systems of objects ?‚Äù At the middle school level, the PS 2 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into two sub -ideas:  Forces and Motion  and Types of interactions. By the end of middle school , students will be able to apply  Newton‚Äôs Third Law of Motion to relate forces to explain the motion of objects. S tudents also apply ideas about gravitational, electric al, and magnetic forces  to explain a variety of phenomena including beginning ideas about  why some materials attract each other while other s repel.  In particular, students will develop understanding that gravitational interactions are always attractive but that September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc.

Students also d evelop ideas that objects can exert forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact, through fields. Students are also able to apply an engineering practice and concept to solve a problem caused when objects collide. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect ; system and system models ; stability and change ; and the influence of science, engineering, and technology on society and the natural world  serve as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.

The performance expectations in PS3: Energy  help students formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúHow can energy be transferred from one object or system to another ?‚Äù At the middle school level, the PS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into four sub-core ideas:  Definitions of Energy, Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the Relationship between Energy and Forces , and Energy in Chemical Process and Everyday Life. Students develop their understand ing of important quali tative ideas about energy including  that the interactions of objects can be explained and predicted using the concept of transfer of energy from one object or system of objects to another , and the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the  total energy transferred into or out of the system.  Students understand that  object s that are moving have kinetic energy and that objects may also contain stored (potential) energy, depending on their relative positions. Students will also come to know the difference between energy and temperature , and begin to develop an understanding of the relationship between force and energy. Students are also able to apply an understanding of design to the process of energy transfer. The crosscutting concepts of s cale, proportion, and quantity ; system s and system models ; and energy are called out as  organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. The performance expectation s in PS3 expect students to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, pl anning investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, and designing solutions,  and engaging in argument from evidence ; and to  use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas  in PS3 .

Atoms form molecules that range in size from two to thousands of atoms. (MS-PS1-1) ‚ñ™ Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that can be used to identify it. (MS-PS1-2),(MS-PS1-3) ‚ñ™ Gases and liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms that are moving about relative to each other.  (MS-PS1-4) ‚ñ™ In a liquid, the molecules are constantly in contact with others; in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to collide. In a solid, atoms are closely spaced and may vibrate in position but do not chan ge relative locations.

In science, heat is used only for this second meaning; it refers to the energy transferred due to the temperature difference between two objects. (secondary to MS - PS1-4) ‚ñ™ The temperature of a system is proportional to the average internal kinetic energy and potential energy per atom or molecule (whichever is the a ppropriate building block for the system‚Äôs material).  The details of that relationship depend on the type of atom or molecule and the interactions among the atoms in the material. Temperature is not a direct measure of a system's total thermal energy.

( MS-PS2-2),(MS-PS2-4) Disciplinary Core Ideas PS2.A:  Forces and Motion ‚ñ™ For any pair of interacting objects, the force exerted by the first object on the second object is equal in strength to the force that the second object exerts on the first, but in the opposite direction (Newton‚Äôs third law). (MS-PS2-1) ‚ñ™ The motion of an object is determined by the sum of the forces acting on it; if the total force on the object is not zero, its motion will change. The greater the mass of the object, the greater the force needed to achieve the same change in motion. For an y given object, a larger force causes a larger change in motion.  (MS-PS2-2) ‚ñ™ All positions of objects and the directions of forces and motions must be described in an arbitrarily chosen reference frame and arb itrarily chosen units of size. In order to share  information with other people, these choices must also be shared. (MS- PS2-2) PS2.B:  Types of Interactions ‚ñ™ Electric and magnetic (electromagnetic) forces can be attractive or repulsive, and their sizes depend on the magnitudes of the charges, currents, or magnetic strengths involved and on the distances between the interacting objects. ( MS-PS2-3) ‚ñ™ Gravitational forces are always attractive. There is a gravitational force between any two masses, but it is very small except when one or both of the objects hav e large mass ‚Äîe.g., Earth and the sun. (MS-PS2-4) ‚ñ™ Forces that act at a distance (electric , magnetic , and gravitational ) can be explained by fields that extend through space and can be mapped by their effect on a test object ( a charged object, or  a ball, respectively).

The ideas build  upon students‚Äô science understanding from earlier grades and from the disciplinary core ideas, science and  engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts  of other experiences with physical and earth sciences . There are four life s cience disciplinary core ideas in middle school: 1) From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes, 2) Ecosystems: Interact ions, Energy, and Dynamics, 3) Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits, 4) Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity . The performance expectations in middle school blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concep ts to support students in developing useable knowledge across the science disciplines. While the performance expectations in middle school life science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should includ e use of many science and engineering practices integrated in  the performance expectations. The performance expectations in LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes  help students formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúHow can one explain the ways cells contribute to the function of living organisms. ‚Äù The LS1 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is organized into  four sub -ideas:  Structure and Function, Growth and Development of Organisms, Organization for Mat ter and Energy Flow in Organisms, and Information Processing . Students can gather information  and use this information to support explanations of the structure and function relationship of cells . They can communicate understanding of cell th eory. They have a basic understanding of the role of cells in body systems and how those systems work to support the life functions of the organism. The understanding of cells provides a contex t for the plant process of photosynthesis and the movement of matter and energ y needed for the cell. Students can construct an explanation for how environmental and genetic factors affect growth of organism s.  They can connect this to the role of animal behaviors in reproduction of animals as well as the dependence  of some plants on  animal behaviors  for the ir reproduction. Crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, structure and function, and matter and energy are called out as organizing concepts for  the core ideas about proces ses of living organisms. The performance expectations in LS2: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics Relationships in Ecosystems  help student s formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúHow does a system of living and non -living things operate to meet the needs of the organisms in an ecosystem?‚Äù  The LS2 Disciplinary Core Idea is  divided into three  sub-ideas:  Interdepend ent Relationships in Ecosystems;  Cycles of Matter an d Energy Transfer in Ecosystems; and  Ecosystem Dynami cs, Functioning, and Resilience . Students can analyze and interpret data, develop model s, and construct  argument s and demonstrate  a deeper understanding of resources and the cycling of matter and the flow of energy in ecosystem s. They can also study patterns of the interactions among organisms within  an ecosystem. They consider biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem and the effects these factors have on po pulation. They evaluate competing design solutions for maintaining biodiversity  and ecosystem services. The performance expectations in LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits  help students formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúHow do living organism s pass traits from one generation to the next?‚Äù The LS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  includes two sub-ideas:  Inheritance of Traits, and Variation of Traits.  Stude nts can use models to describe September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved. 56 of 103 ways gene mutations and sexual reproduction contr ibute to genetic variation.  Crosscutting concepts of cause and effect and structure and function provide students with a de eper understanding of how gene structure determines differences in the functioning of organisms. The performance expectations in LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity  help students formulate an answer to the questio n, ‚ÄúHow do organisms  change over time in response to changes in the environment?‚Äù The LS4 Disciplinary Core Idea is divided into four sub-ideas:  Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity, Natural Selection , Adaptation , and Biodiversity and Humans . Students can construct expl anations based on evidence to support fundamental understand ings of natural selection and evolution. They  can use ideas of genetic variation in a population to make sense of organisms surviving and reproducin g, hence passing on the traits of the species. T hey are able to use fossil records and anatomical similarities of the relationships among organisms and species  to support their understanding . Crosscutting concepts of patterns and structure and function contribute to the evidence students can use to describe biological evolution. September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc.

(MS-LS2-4) ‚ñ™ Evaluate competing design solutions based on jointly developed and agreed -upon design criteria.  (MS-LS2- 5) ---------------------------------------------- Connection s to Nature of Science Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence ‚ñ™ Science disciplines share common rules of obtaining and evaluating empirical evidence.  (MS-LS2-4) Disciplinary Core Ideas LS2.A:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems ‚ñ™ Organisms, and populations of organisms, are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other living things and with nonliving factors . (MS-LS2-1) ‚ñ™ In any ecosystem, organisms and populations with similar requirements for food, water, oxygen, or other resources may compete with each other for limited resources, access to which consequently constrains their growth and reproduction.  (MS-LS2- 1) ‚ñ™ Growth of organisms and population increases are lim ited by access to resources.  (MS-LS2-1) ‚ñ™ Similarly,  predatory interactions may reduce the number of organisms or eliminate whol e populations of organisms. Mutually beneficial interactions, in contrast, may become so interdependent that each organism requires the other for survival. Although the species involved in these competitive, predatory, and mutually beneficial interactions vary across ecosystems, the patterns of interactions of organisms with thei r environments, both living and nonliving, are shared.  (MS-LS2-2) LS2.B:  Cycle of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems ‚ñ™ Food webs are models that demonstrate how matter and energy is transferred between producers , consumers, and decomposers as the three groups interact  within an ecosystem. Transfers of matter into and out of the physical environment occur at every level. Decomposers recycle nutrients from dead plant or animal matter back to the soil in terrestrial environments or to the water in aquatic environments. The atoms that make up the organisms in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly between the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. ( MS-LS2-3) LS2.C:  Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience ‚ñ™ Ecosystems are dynamic in nature; their characteristics can vary over time. Disruptions to any physical or biological component of an ecosystem can lead to  shifts in all its populations. (MS-LS2-4) ‚ñ™ Biodiversity describes the variety of species found in Ear th‚Äôs terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. The completeness or integrity of an ecosystem‚Äôs biodiversity is often used as a measure of its health.  (MS-LS2-5) LS4.D:  Biodiversity and Humans ‚ñ™ Changes in biodiversity can influence humans‚Äô resources, such as food, energy, and medicines, as well as ecosystem services that humans rely on ‚Äîfor example, water purification and recycling. (secondary to MS-LS2-5) ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions ‚ñ™ There are systematic processes for evaluating solutions with respect  to how well they meet the criteria and constraints of a problem. (secondary to MS-LS2-5) Crosscutting Concepts Patterns ‚ñ™ Patterns can be used to identify cau se and effect relationships. ( MS-LS2-2) Cause and Effect ‚ñ™ Cause and effect relationships may be used to predict phenomena in natural or designed systems. (MS-LS2-1) Energy and Matter ‚ñ™ The transfer of energy can be tracked as energy flows through  a natural system. (MS- LS2-3) Stability and Change ‚ñ™ Small changes in one part of a system might cause large changes in another part. (MS - LS2-4),(MS-LS2-5) -------------------------------------------------- Connection s to Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science Influence of Science, Engineering, and Technology on Society and the Natural World ‚ñ™ The use of technologies  and any limitations on their use  are driven by  individual or societal  needs, desires, and values; by the findings of scientific research; and by differences in such factors as climate, nat ural resources, and economic conditions. Thus technology use varies from regio n to region and over time. ( MS-LS2-5) ------------------------------------------------ Connection s to Nature of Science Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order and Consistency in  Natural Systems ‚ñ™ Science assumes that objects and events in natural systems occur in consistent patterns that are understandable through measur ement and observation.

(MS-LS3-1),(MS-LS3-2) Disciplinary Core Ideas LS1.B:  Growth and Development of Organisms ÔÇß O rganisms reproduce, eit her sexually or asexually, and transfer their genetic information to their offspring. (secondary to MS- LS3-2) LS3.A:  Inheritance of Traits ÔÇß Genes are located in the chromosomes of cells, with each chromosome pair containing two variants of  each of many distinct genes. Each distinct gene chiefly controls the production of specific proteins, which in turn affect s the traits of the indiv idual . Changes (mutations) to genes can result in changes to proteins, which can affect the structures and functions of the organism and  thereby  change traits. ( MS-LS3-1) ÔÇß V ariations of inherited traits between parent and offs pring arise from genetic differences that result from the subset of chromosomes (and therefore genes) inherited . (MS-LS3-2) LS3.B:  Variation of Traits ÔÇß In sexually  reproducing organisms, each parent contributes half of the genes acquired (at random) by  the offspring . Individuals hav e two of each chromosome and hence two alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent. These versions may be identical or may  differ from each other. ( MS-LS3-2) ÔÇß In addition to v ariations that arise from sexual reproduction, genetic information can be altered  because of mutations. Though rare, mutations may result in changes to the structure and function of proteins. Some changes are beneficial, others harmful, and  some neutral to the organism . (MS-LS3-1) Crosscutting Concepts Cause and Effect ÔÇß C ause and effect relationships may be used to predict phenomena i n natural sy stems.

(MS-LS4- 1) Disciplinary Core Ideas LS4.A:  Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity ‚ñ™ The collection of fossils and their placement in chronological order (e.g., through the location of the sedimentary layers in which they are found or through radioactive dating) is known as the fossil record. It documents the ex istence, diversity, extinction, and change of many life forms th roughout the history of life on Earth. (MS-LS4-1) ‚ñ™ Anatomical similarities and differences between various organisms living today and between them and organisms in the fossil record, enable the reconstruction of evolutionary history and the inference of lin es of evolutionary descent.

(MS-LS4-3) LS4.B:  Natural Selection ‚ñ™ Natural selection  leads to the predominance of certain traits in a population, and the suppression of others. (MS-LS4-4) ‚ñ™ In artificial selection, humans have the capacity to influence certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding. One can choose desired parental traits determined by genes, which are then passed on to offspring. ( MS-LS4-5) LS4.C:  Adaptation ‚ñ™ Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is one important process by which species change over time in response to changes in environmental conditions. Traits that support successful survival and reproduction in the new environment become mo re common; those that do not become less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a population changes.

The middle  school performance expectations  in Earth Space  Science build on the elementary  school ideas and skills and  allow middle  school students to explain more in -depth phenomena central  not only  to the earth and space  science s, but to life and physical  science s as well .  These performance expectations blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts  to support students in developing useable knowledge  to explain ideas across the science disciplines .  While the performance expectations show n in middle school earth and space  science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance expectations. The performance expectations in ESS1:  Earth‚Äôs Place in the Universe , help students formulate an answer to question s such as :  ‚ÄúWhat is Earth‚Äôs place in the Universe, What makes up our solar system and how can the motion of Earth explain seasons and eclipses, and How do people figure out that the  Earth and life on Earth have changed through time? ‚Äù  The ESS1 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into three sub-ideas: the universe and its stars, Earth and the solar system and the history of planet Earth .  Students examine the Earth‚Äôs place in relation to the solar system, Milky Way galaxy, and universe. There is a strong emphasis on a systems approach, using models of the solar system  to explain astronomical and other observations of the cyclic pat terns of eclipses  and seasons.  There is also a strong connection to engineering through the instruments and technologies that have allowed us to explore the objects in our solar system and obtain the data that support the theories that explain the formation and evolution of the univers e.  Students examine geoscience data in order to understand the processes and events in Earth‚Äôs history.  The crosscutting concepts of patterns, scale, proportion, and quantity, and systems and systems modeling  are called out as organizing concepts for th ese disciplinary core ideas .  In the ES S1 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, analyzing data, and constructing explanations and designing solutions ; and to use these practices to demons trate understanding of the core ideas. The performance expectations in ESS2:  Earth‚Äôs Systems , help students formulate an answer to questions such as:  ‚ÄúHow do the materials in and on Earth‚Äôs crust change over time, How does the movement of tectonic pla tes impact the surface of Earth, How does water influence weather, circulate in the oceans, and shape Earth‚Äôs surface, What factors interact and influence weather, and How have living organisms changed the Earth and how have Earth‚Äôs changing conditions imp acted living organisms?‚Äù  The ESS2 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into five sub-ideas: Earth materials and systems, plate tectonics and large-scale system interactions, the roles of water in Earth‚Äôs surface processes , weather and climate, and bioge ology.  Students understand how Earth‚Äôs geosystems operate by modeling the flow of energy and cycling of matter within and among different systems. Students investigate the controlling properties of important materials and construct e xplanations based on the analysis of real geoscience data. Of special importance in both topics are the ways that geoscience processes provide resources needed by society but also cause natural hazards that present risks to society; both involve technologi cal challenges, for the identification and development of resources.  Students develop understanding of the factors that control weather. A systems approach is also important here, examining the feedbacks between systems as September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc.

The crosscutting concepts of patterns, cause and effect , scale proportion and quantity, systems and system models, energy and matter, and stability and change are called out as organizing co ncepts for these disci plinary core ideas.  In the ESS2  performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations , analyzing and interpreting data , and constructing explanations ; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. The performance expectations in ESS3:  Earth  and Human A ctivity  help students formulate an answer to questions such as:  ‚ÄúHow is the availability of needed natural resources related to naturally occurring processes, How can natural hazards be predicted, How do human activities affect Earth systems,  How do we know our global climate is changing?‚Äù   The ESS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into four sub -ideas: natural resources, natural hazards, human impact on Earth systems, and global climate change.  Students understand the ways that human activities impacts Earth‚Äôs other systems. Students use many different practices to understand the si gnificant and complex issues surrounding human uses of land, energy, mineral, and water resources and the resulting impacts of their development. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, cause and effect, and stability and change are called out as organizing  concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the ESS 3 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data,  constructing explanations and designing solutions and engaging in argument ; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

ÔÇßDesign, evaluate, and/or refine  a solution to aDisciplinary Core Ideas PS3.A:  Definitions of Energy ÔÇßEnergy is a quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system.  That there is a single quantity called energy is due to the fact that a system‚Äôs total energy is conserved, even as, within the system, energy is continually transferred from one object to another and between its various possible forms. ( HS- PS3-1),(HS-PS3-2) ÔÇßAt the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways, such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy.  (HS- PS3-2) (HS-PS3-3) ÔÇßThese relationships are better understood at the micr oscopic scale, at which all of the different manifestations of energy can be modeled as a combination of energy associated with the motion of particles and energy associated with the configuration (relative position of the particles). In some cases the rel ative position energy can be thought of as stored in fields (which mediate interactions between particles).  This last concept includes radiation, a phenomenon in which energy stored in fields moves across space. (HS-PS3-2) PS3.B:   Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer ÔÇßConservation of energy means that the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred int o or out of the system. ( HS-PS3-1) ÔÇßEnergy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transported from one place to another and transferred bet ween systems. (HS-PS3-1),(HS-PS3-4) ÔÇßMathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on its configuration (e.g. relative positions of charged particles, compressi on of a spring) and how kinetic energy depends on mass and speed, allow the concept of conservation of energy to be used to predict and describe system behavior.

(HS-PS4-5) ----------------------------------------------------- Connection s to Nature of Science Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain Natural Phenomena ÔÇßA scientific theory is a substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment and the science community validates each theory before it is accepted. I f new evidence is discovered that the theory does not accommodate, the theory is generally modified in light of this new evidence.

(secondary to HS-PS4-5) PS4.A:   Wave Properties ÔÇßThe wavelength and frequency of a wave are related to one another by the speed of travel of the wave, which depends on the type of wave and the medium t hrough which it is passing. ( HS-PS4-1) ÔÇßInformation can be digitized (e.g., a picture stored as the values of an array of pixels); in this form, it can be stored reliably in computer memory and sent over long distances as a series of wave pulses.  (HS-PS4-2),(HS- PS4-5) ÔÇß[From the 3 ‚Äì5 grade band endpoints] Waves can add or cancel one another as they cross, depending on their relative phase (i.e., relative position of peaks and troughs of the waves), but they emerge unaffected by each other. (Boundary: The discu ssion at this grade level is qualitative only; it can be based on the fact that two different sounds can pass a location in different directions without getting mixed up.)  (HS-PS4-3) PS4.B:  Electromagnetic Radiation ÔÇßElectromagnetic radiation (e.g., radio, microwaves, light) can be modeled as a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles called photons. The wave model is useful for explaining many features of electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model explains other features. (HS-PS4-3) ÔÇßWhen light or longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation is absorbed in matter, it is generally converted into thermal energy (heat). Shorter wavelength electromagnetic radiation (ultraviolet, X -rays, gamma rays) can ionize atoms and c ause damage to living cells. (HS-PS4-4) ÔÇßPhotoelectric materials emit electrons when they absorb light of a high -enough frequency.  (HS-PS4-5) PS4.C:  Information Technologies and Instrumentation ÔÇßMultiple  technologies based on the understanding of waves and their interactions with matter are part of everyday experiences in the modern world (e.g., medical imaging, communications, scanners) and in scientific research. They are essential tools for producing, transmitting, and capturing signals and for storing and interpreting the information contained in them. ( HS-PS4-5)Crosscutting Concepts Cause and E ffect ÔÇßEmpirical evidence is required to differentiate between cause and correlation and make claims about specific causes and effects. ( HS-PS4-1) ÔÇßCause and effect relationships can be suggested and predicted for complex natural and human designed systems by examining what is known about smaller scale mechanisms within the system.

The ideas are buil t upon s tudents‚Äô science understanding  of disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts from earlier grades. There are four life s cience disciplinary core ideas in high  school:  1) From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes, 2) Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics, 3) Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits, 4) Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity . The performance expectations  for high school life science blend core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and cro sscutting concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge that can be applied across the science disciplines. While the pe rformance expectations in high  school life science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include  use of many practices underlying  the performance expectations. The performance expectations in LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes  help students formulate an answer  to the question , ‚ÄúHow do organisms live  and grow?‚Äù  The LS1 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is presented as  three sub- ideas:  Structure and Function, Growth and Development of Organisms, and Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms . In these performance expectations , students demonstrate that they can use investigations  and gather evidence to support explanations of cell function and reproduction. They understand the role of proteins as essential to the work of the cell and living systems. Student s can use mod els to explain  photosynthesis , respiration , and the cycling of matter and flow of energy in living organisms. The cellular processes can be  used as a model for  understanding of the hierarchical  organization of organism. Crosscutting concepts of m atter and energy, structure and function , and systems and system models  provide student s with insights to the structures and processes  of organisms. The performance expectations in LS2: Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics help student s formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúHow and why do organisms interact with their environment, and what are the effects of these interactions?‚Äù  The LS2 Disciplinary Core Idea includes  four sub -ideas:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems, Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems, Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience, and Social Interactions and Group Behavior. High school students can use mathematical reasoning to demonstrate  understanding of fundamental concepts of carrying capacity, factors affecting biodiversity and populations , and the cycling of matter and flow of energy among organisms in an ecosystem.  These mathematical models provide support of students‚Äô  conceptual understanding of systems and their ability to  develop  design solutions for reducing the impact of human activities on the environment and maintaining biodiversity . Crosscutting concepts of systems and system models play a  central role in students‚Äô understanding of science and engineering practices and core i deas of ecosystems. The performance expectations in LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits  help students formulate answer s to the question s:  ‚ÄúHow are characteristics of one generation passed to the next ? How can individuals of the same species and even siblings have different characteristics?‚Äù The LS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  includes two sub- ideas:  Inheritance of Traits , and Variation of Traits.  Students are able to ask questions, make and defend a claim, and use concepts of probab ility to explain the genetic variation in a September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved. 85 of 103 population. Students demonstrate understanding of w hy individuals of the same species vary in how they look, function, and behave. Students can explain the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and describe the environmental and genetic causes of gene mutation and the alteration of gene expression.   Crosscutting concepts of patterns and cause and effect are called out as organizing concepts for these core ideas. The performance expectations in LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity  help students formulate an answer to the question , ‚ÄúWhat evidence shows that different species are related? The LS4 Disciplinary Core Idea involves four sub -ideas:  Evidence o f Common Ancestry and Diversity, Natural Selection, Adaptation, and Biodiversity and Humans. Students  can construct explanations for the processes of natural select ion and evolution and communicate how multi ple lines of evidence support  these explanations. Students can evaluate evidence of the condition s that may result in new species and understand the role of genetic variation in natural selection .   Additionally , students  can apply concepts of probability to explain trends in populati ons as those trends  relate to a dvantageous heritable traits in a specific  environment. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect and systems and system models  play an important rol e in students ‚Äô understanding of the evolution of life on Earth.

ÔÇßPlan and conduct an investigation individually and collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for evidence, and in the design: decide on types, how much, and accuracy of data needed to produce reliable measurements and consider limitations on the precision of the data (e.g., number of trials, cost, risk, time), and refine the design accordingly. (HS -LS1-3) Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions Constructing explanations and designing s olutions in 9 ‚Äì12 builds on K‚Äì8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs that are supported by multiple and independent student - generated sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas, principles,  and theories. ÔÇßConstruct an explanation based on valid and reliable evidence obtained from a variety of sources (including students‚Äô own investigations, models, theories, simulations, peer review) and the assumption that theories and laws that describe the natural world operate today as they did in the past and will continue to do so in the future. (HS -LS1-1) ÔÇßConstruct and revise an explanation based on  valid and reliable evidence obtained from a variety of sources (including students‚Äô own investigations,  models, theories, simulations, peer review) and the assumption that theories and laws that describe the natural world operate today as they did in the past and will continue to do so in the future. (HS -LS1-6)Disciplinary Core Ideas LS1.A:  Structure and Function ÔÇßSystems of specialized cells within organisms help them perform the essential functions of life. (HS-LS1-1) ÔÇßAll cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code for the formation of proteins, which carry out most of the work of cells. (HS -LS1-1) (Note: This Disci plinary Core Idea is also addressed by HS -LS3- 1.) ÔÇßMulticellular organisms have a hierarchical structural organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous parts and is itself a component of the next level. ( HS-LS1-2) ÔÇßFeedback mechanisms maintai n a living system‚Äôs internal conditions within certain limits and mediate behaviors, allowing it to remain alive and functional even as external conditions change within some range. Feedback mechanisms can encourage (through positive feedback) or discourag e (negative feedback) what is going on inside the living system. (HS -LS1-3) LS1.B:  Growth and Development of Organisms ÔÇßIn multicellular organisms individual cells grow and then divide  via a process called mitosis , thereby allowing the organism to grow.  The organism begins as a single cell (fertilized egg) that divides successively to produce many cells, with each parent cell passing identical genetic material (two variants of each chromosome pair) to both daughter cells.  Cellular division and differentiation produce and maintain a complex organism, composed of systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the needs of the whole organism. (HS -LS1-4) LS1.C:  Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms ÔÇßThe process of photosynthesis converts light energy to stored chemical energy by converting carbon dioxide plus water into sugars plus released oxygen. (HS-LS1-5) ÔÇßThe sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen : their hydrocarbon backb ones are used to make amino acids and other carbon- based molecules that can be assembled into larger molecules (such as proteins or DNA), used for example to form new cells. (HS -LS1-6) ÔÇßAs matter and energy flow through differentCrosscutting Concepts System s and System Models ÔÇßModels (e.g., physical, mathematical, computer models) can be used to simulate systems and interactions‚Äî including energy,  matter, and information flows ‚Äîwithin and between systems at different scales. ( HS-LS1-2), (HS-LS1-4) Energy and Matter ÔÇßChanges of energy and matter in a system can be described in terms of energy and matter flows into, out of, and within that system.  (HS-LS1-5), (HS-LS1-6) ÔÇßEnergy cannot be created or destroyed ‚Äîit only moves between one place and another place, between objects and/or fields, or between systems.  (HS-LS1-7) Structure and Function ÔÇßInvestigating or designing new systems or structures requires a detailed examination of the properties of different materials, the structures of different components, and connections of components to reveal its function and/or solve a problem.

(HS -LS1-3)organizational levels of li ving systems, chemical elements are recombined in different ways to form different products. (HS-LS1-6),(HS -LS1-7) ÔÇßAs a result of these chemical reactions, energy is transferred from one system of interacting molecules to another. Cellular respiration is a  chemical process in which the bonds of food molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and new compounds are formed that ca n transport energy to muscles. Cellular respiration also releases the energy needed to maintain body temperature despite ongoing ener gy transfer to the surrounding environment.

ÔÇßDevelop a model  based on evidence  to illustrate  the relationships between systems or components of a system. (HS -LS2-5) Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking Mathematical and computational thinking  in 9-12 builds on K-8 experiences  and progresses to using algebraic thinking and analysis, a range of linear and nonlinear functions including trigonometric functions, exponentials and logarithms, and computational tools for statistical analysis to analy ze, represent, and model data.

ÔÇßUse mathematical  and/or  computational representatio ns of phenomena or design solutions to support  explanations . (HS-LS2-1) ÔÇßUse mathematical representations  of phenomena or design solutions to support and  revise explanations . (HS-LS2-2) ÔÇßUse mathematical representations  of phenomena or design solutions to support claims.

ÔÇßConstruct and revise an explanation based on valid and reliable evidence obtained from a variety of sources ( including students‚Äô own investigations, models, theories, simulations, peer review) and the assumption that theories and laws that describe the natural world  operate today as they did in the pastDisciplinary Core Ideas LS2.A:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems ÔÇßEcosystems have carrying capacities, which are limits to the numbers of organisms and populations they can support. These limits result from such factors as the availability of living and nonliving resources and from such challenges such as predation, competition, and disease. Organisms would have the capacity to produce populations of great size were it not for the fact that environments and r esources are finite. This fundamental tension affects the abundance (number of individuals) of species in any given ecosystem. ( HS-LS2-1),(HS- LS2-2) LS2.B:  Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems ÔÇßPhotosynthesis and cellular respiration (including anaerobic processes) provide most of the energy for life processes. (HS-LS2-3) ÔÇßPlants or algae form the lowest level of the foo d web. At each link upward in a food web, only a small fraction of the matter consumed at the lower level is transferred upward, to produce growth and release energy in cellular respiration at the higher level. Given this inefficiency, there are generally fewer organisms at higher levels of a food web. Some  matter reacts to release energy for life functions, some matter is stored in newly made structures, and much is discarded. The chemical elements that make up the molecules of organisms pass through food webs and into and o ut of the atmosphere and soil, and they are combined and recombined in different ways. At each link in an ecosystem, matter and energy are conserved . (HS-LS2-4) ÔÇßPhotosynthesis and cellular respiration are important components of the carbon cycle, in which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and  geosphere through chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. (HS -LS2-5) LS2.C:  E cosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience ÔÇßA complex set of interactions within an ecosystem can keep its numbers and types of organisms relatively constant over long periods of time under stable conditions.  If a modest biological or physical disturban ce to an ecosystem occurs, it may return to its more or less original status (i.e., the ecosystem is resilient), as opposed to becoming a very different ecosystem. Extreme fluctuations in conditions or the size of any population, however, can challenge the  functioning of ecosystems in terms of resources and habitat availability. (HS -LS2-2),(HS-LS2-6)Crosscutting Concepts Cause and Effect ÔÇßEmpirical evidence is required to differentiate between cause and correlation and make claims about specific causes and effects. (HS-LS2-8) Scale, Proportion, and Quantity ÔÇßThe significance of a phenomenon is dependent on the scale, proportion, and quantity  at which it occurs. (HS -LS2-1) ÔÇßUsing the concept of orders of magnitude allows one to understand how a model at one scale relates to a model at another scale.  (HS-LS2-2) Systems and System Models ÔÇßModels (e.g., physical, mathematical, computer models) can be used to simulate systems and interactions‚Äî including energy, matter, and information flows‚Äîwithin and between systems at different scales.  (HS-LS2-5) Energy and Matter ÔÇßEnergy cannot be created or destroyed ‚Äî it only moves between one place and another pla ce, between objects and/or fields, or between systems. (HS-LS2-4) ÔÇßEnergy drives the cycling of matter within and between systems.  (HS-LS2-3) Stability and Change ÔÇßMuch of science deals with constructing explanations of how things change and how they remain stable. (HS-LS2-6),(HS- LS2-7) September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc.

(HS-LS2-6) ÔÇßEvaluate the  evidence behind currently accepted explanations  to determine the merits of arguments . (HS-LS2-8) ------------------------------------------------------- Connection s to Nature of Science Scientific Knowledge is Open to Revision in Light of New E vidence ÔÇßMost scientific knowledge is quite durable, but is, in principle, subject to change based on new evidence and/or reinterpretation of existing evidence.  (HS- LS2-2),(HS-LS2-3) ÔÇßScientific argumentation is a mode of logical discourse used to clarify the strength of relationships between ideas and evidence that may result in revision of an explanation . (HS-LS2-6),(HS-LS2-8)ÔÇßMoreover, anthropogenic changes (induced by human activity) in the environment‚Äî including habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, overexploitation, a nd climate change ‚Äîcan disrupt an ecosystem and threaten the survival of some species. ( HS-LS2-7) LS2.D:  Social Interactions and Group Behavior ÔÇßGroup behavior has evolved because membership can increase the chances of survival for individuals and their genetic relatives. ( HS- LS2-8) LS4.D:  Biodiversity and Humans ÔÇßBiodiversity is increased by the formation of new species (speciation) and decreased by the loss  of species (extinction ). (secondary to HS- LS2-7) ÔÇßHumans depend on the living world for the resources and other benefits provided by biodiversity. But human activity is also having adverse impacts on biodiversity through overpopulation, overexploitation, habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, and climate change. Thus sustaining biodiversity so that ecosystem functioning and productivity are maintained is essential to supporting and enhancing li fe on Earth. Sustaining biodiversity also aids humanity by preserving landscapes of recreational or inspirational value.

ÔÇßMake and defend a claim  based on evidence about the natural world that reflects scientific knowledge, and student -generated evidence. (HS -LS3-2)Disciplinary Core Ideas LS1.A:  Structure and Function ÔÇßAll cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code for the formation of proteins . (secondary to HS -LS3-1) (Note: This Disciplinary Core Idea is also addressed by HS -LS1-1.) LS3.A:  Inheritance of Traits ÔÇßEach chromosome consists of a single very long DNA molecule, and each gene on the chromosome is a particular segment of that DNA. The instructions for forming species‚Äô characteristics are carried in DNA. All cells in an organism have the same genetic conte nt, but the genes used (expressed) by the cell may be regulated in different ways. Not all DNA codes for a protein; some segments of DNA are involved in regulatory or structural functions, and some have no as-yet known function. (HS-LS3-1) LS3.B:  Variation of Traits ÔÇßIn sexual reproduction, chromosomes can sometimes swap sections during the process of meiosis (cell division), thereby creating new genetic combinations and thus  more genetic variation. Although  DNA replication  is tightly  regulated  and remarkably  accurate, errors  do occur  and result  in mutations,  which  are also a source  of genetic  variation.  Environmental factors can also cause mutations in genes, and viable mutations are inherited. ( HS-LS3-2) ÔÇßEnvironmental  factors  also  affect  expression  of traits, and hence  affect  the probability of occurrences of traits in a population. Thus the variation and distribution of traits observed depends on both genetic and environmental factors. ( HS-LS3-2),(HS-LS3-3)Crosscutting Concepts Cause and Effect ÔÇßEmpirical evidence is required to differentiate between cause and correlation and make claims about specific causes and effects. ( HS-LS3-1),(HS-LS3-2) Scale, Proportion, and Quantity ÔÇßAlgebraic thinking is used to examine scientific data and predict the effect of a change in one variable on another (e.g., linear growth vs. exponential growth).

(HS -LS4-5) Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating  Information Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information in 9 ‚Äì12 Disciplinary Core Ideas LS4.A:  Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity ÔÇßGenetic infor mation provides evidence of evolution. DNA sequences vary among  species, but there are many overlaps; in fact,  the ongoing branching that produces multiple lines of descent can be inferred by comparing  the DNA sequences  of different organisms. Such information is also derivable from the similarities and differences in amino acid sequences and from anatomi cal and embryological evidence. ( HS-LS4-1) LS4.B:  Natural Selection ÔÇßNatural selection occurs only if there is both (1) variation in the genetic information betwe en organisms in a population and (2) variation in the expression of that genetic information ‚Äîthat is, trait variation ‚Äîthat leads to differences in perform ance among individuals. (HS -LS4-2),(HS-LS4-3) ÔÇßThe traits that positively affect survival are more like ly to be reproduced, and thus are more common in the population. (HS-LS4-3) LS4.C:  Adaptation ÔÇßEvolution is a consequence of the interaction of four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the genetic variation of individuals in  a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for an environment‚Äôs limited supply of the resources that individuals need in order to survive and reproduce, and (4) the ensuing proliferation of those organisms that are better able to s urvive and reproduce in that environment. ( HS-LS4-2) ÔÇßNatural selection leads to adaptation, that is, to a population dominated by organisms that are anatomically, behaviorally, and physiologically well suited to survive and reproduce in a specific environm ent. That is, the differential survival and reproduction of organisms in a population that have an advantageous heritable trait leads to an increase in the proportion of individuals in future generations that have the trait and to a decrease in the proport ion of individuals that do not. ( HS-LS4-3),(HS-LS4-4) ÔÇßAdaptation also means that the distribution of traits in a population can change when conditions change. (HS-LS4-3) ÔÇßChanges in the physical environment, whether naturally occurring or human induced, hav e thus contributed to the expansion of some species, the emergence of new distinct species as populations diverge under different conditions, and the decline ‚Äìand sometimes t he extinction ‚Äìof some species. (HS-LS4-5),(HS-LS4-6)Crosscutting Concepts Patterns ÔÇßDifferent patterns may be observed at each of the scales at which a system is studied and can provide evidence for causality in explanations of phenomena. (HS-LS4-1),(HS-LS4-3) Cause and Effect ÔÇßEmpirical evidence is required to differentiate between cause and correlation and make claims about specif ic causes and effects.

If new evidence is discovered that the theory does not accommodate, the theory is generally modified in light of this new evidence. (HS-LS4-1)ÔÇßSpecies become extinct because  they can no longer survive and reproduce in their altered environment. If members cannot adjust to change that is too fast or drastic, the opportunity for the species‚Äô evolution is lost. ( HS-LS4-5) LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans ÔÇßHumans depend on the living world for the resources and other benefits provided by biodiversity. But human activity is also having adverse impacts on biodiversity through overpopulation, overexploitation, habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, and cl imate change. Thus sustaining biodiversity so that ecosystem functioning and productivity are maintained is essential to supporting and enhancing life on Earth. Sustaining biodiversity also aids humanity by preserving landscapes of recreational or inspirat ional value. (HS-LS4-6) (Note: This Disciplinary Core Idea is also addressed by HS -LS2- 7.) ETS1.

(secondary to HS-LS4-6) ÔÇßBoth physical models and computers can be used in various ways to aid in the engineering design process. Computers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as running simulations to test different ways of solving a problem or to see which one is most efficient or economical; and in m aking a persuasive presentation to a client about how a given design will meet his or her needs.

All rights reserved. 93 of 103 High School Earth  and Space Science s Students in high school continue to  develop their understanding of the three disciplinary core ideas in the Earth and S pace Science s.  The high school performance expectations  in Earth and Space  Science build on the middle school ideas and skills and  allow high school students  to explain more in -depth phenomena central  not only  to the earth  and space  science s, but to life and physical  science s as well .  These performance expectations blend the core ideas with scientif ic and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts  to support students in developing useable knowledge  to explain ideas across the science disciplines .  While the performance expectations shown in high school earth and space  science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance expectations. The performance expectations in ESS1:  Earth‚Äôs Place in the Universe , help students formulate an answer to the question:  ‚ÄúWhat is the universe, and what is Earth‚Äôs place in it? ‚Äù The ESS1 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into three sub-ideas: the universe and its stars, Earth and the solar system and the history of planet Earth.  Students examine the processes governing the formation, evolution, and workings of the solar system and universe. Some concepts studied are fundamental to science, such as understanding how the matter of our world formed during the Big Bang and within the cores of stars. Others concepts are practical, such as understanding how short -term changes in the behavior of our sun directly affect humans. Engineering and technology play a large role here in obtaining and analyzing the data that support the theories of the formation of the solar system and universe. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, scale, proportion, and quantity, energy and matter, and stability and change  are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinar y core ideas .  In the ESS1 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, using mathematical and computational thinking, constructing explanations and designing solutions,  engaging in argument, an d obtaining, evaluating and communicating information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. The performance expectations in ESS2:  Earth‚Äôs Systems, help students formulate an answer to the question:  ‚ÄúHow and why is  Earth constantly changing?‚Äù  The ESS2 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into five sub-ideas: Earth materials and systems, plate tectonics and large -scale system interactions, the roles of water in Earth‚Äôs surface processes , weather and climate, and bioge ology .  For the purpose of the NGSS, biogeology has been addressed within the life science standards.  Students develop models and explanations for the ways that feedbacks between different Earth systems control the appearance of Earth‚Äôs surface. Central to this is the tension between internal systems, which are largely responsible for creating land at Earth‚Äôs surface, and the sun -driven surface systems that tear down the land through weathering and erosion. Students begin to examine the ways that human activities cause feedbacks that create changes to other systems.  Students understand the system interactions that control weather and climate, with a major emphasis on the mechanisms and implications of climate change. Students model the flow of energy between different components of the weather system and how this affects chemical cycles such as the carbon cycle. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect , energy and matter, structure and function and stability and change are called out as organizing concepts for these disci plinary core ideas. In the ESS2 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in September 2017 ¬©2013 Achieve, Inc.

The performance expectations in ESS3:  Earth and Human A ctivity  help students formulate an answer to the question:  ‚ÄúHow do Earth‚Äôs surface processes and human activities affect each other? ‚Äù  The ESS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework  is broken down into four sub-ideas: natural resources, natural hazards, human impact on Earth systems, and global climate change.  Students understand the complex and significant interdependencies between humans and the rest of Earth‚Äôs systems through the impacts of natural hazards, our dependencies on natural resources, and the significant environmental impacts of human activities. Engineering and technology figure prominently here, as students use mathematical thinking and the analysis of geoscience data to examine and construct solutions to the many challenges facing long -term human sustainability on Earth .  The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, systems and system models, and stability and change are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the ESS 3 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using analyzing and interpreting data, mathematical and computational thinking, constructing explanations and designing solutions and engaging in argument; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in the sun‚Äôs core to release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation.  [Clarification Statement:   Emphasis is on the energy transfer mechanisms that allow energy from nuclear fusion in the sun‚Äôs core to reach Earth. Examples of evidence for the model include observations of the masses and lifetimes of other stars, as well as the ways that the sun‚Äôs radiation varies due to sudden solar flares (‚Äú space weather‚Äù), the 11- year sunspot cycle, and non-cyclic variation s over centuries.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include details of the atomic and sub -atomic processes involved with the sun‚Äôs nucl ear fusion.] HS-ESS1 -2. Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in  the universe.   [Clarification  Statement:  Emphasis is on the astronomical evidence of the red shift of light from  galaxies as an indication that the universe is currently expanding, the cosmic microwave background as the remnant radiat ion from the Big Bang, and the observed composition of ordinary matter of the universe, primarily found in  stars and interstellar gases (from the spectra of electromagnetic radiation from stars) , which matches that predicted by the Big Bang t heory  (3/4 hydrogen and 1/4 helium ).] HS-ESS1 -3. Communicate scientific ideas about the way  stars , over their life cycle,  produce elements.  [Clarification  Statement: Emphasis is on the way nucleosynthesis, and therefore the different elements created, varies as a function of the mass of a s tar and the stage of its lifetime .] [Assessment Boundary:  Details of the many different nucleosynthesis pathways for stars of differing masses are not assessed. ] HS-ESS1 -4. Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the s olar system .  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on Newtonian gravitational laws governing orbital motions, which apply to human -made satellites as well as planets and moons.] [Assessment Boundary:  Mathematical representations for the gravitational attraction of bo dies and Kepler‚Äôs Laws of orbital motions should not deal with more than two bodies, nor involve calculus.] HS-ESS1 -5. Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of  continental and oceanic crust  and the theory of plate tectonics  to explain the ages of cru stal rocks .  [Clarification Statement:   Emphasis is on the ability of plate tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks. Examples include evidence of the ages oceanic crust increasing with distance from mid -ocean ridges (a result of plate spreading) and the ages of North American continental  crust decreasing with distance away from a central ancient core  of the continental plate  (a result of past plate interactions).] HS-ESS1 -6. Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary surfaces  to construct an  account of Earth‚Äôs formation and early history .  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using available evidence within the solar system to reconstruct the early history of Earth, which formed along with the rest of the  solar system 4.6 billion years ago. Examples  of evidence include the absolute ages of ancient materials (obt ained by radiometric dating of meteorites, moon rocks, and Earth‚Äôs oldest minerals), the sizes and compositions of solar system objects, and the impact cratering record of planetary surfaces.] The performance expectations above were developed using the fo llowing elements from the NRC document  A Framework for K -12 Science Education : Science and Engineering Practices Developing and Using Models Modeling in 9 ‚Äì12 builds on K ‚Äì8 experiences and progresses to using, synthesizing, and developing models to predict and show relationships among variables between systems and their components in the natural and designed world (s).

(HS-ESS1-1) ÔÇßThe study of stars‚Äô light spectra and brightness is used to identify compositional elements of stars, their movements, and their distances from Earth. ( HS-ESS1- 2),(HS-ESS1-3) ÔÇßThe Big Bang theory is supported by observations of distant galaxies receding from our own, of the measured composition of stars and non- stellar gases, and of the maps of spectra of the primordial radiation (cosmic microwave background) that still fills the universe. ( HS- ESS1-2) ÔÇßOther than the hydrogen and helium formed at the time of the Big Bang, nuclear fusion within stars produces all atomic nuclei lighter than and including iron, and the process releases electromagnetic energy. Heavier elements are produced when certain massive stars achieve a supernova stage and explode.  (HS-ESS1- 2),(HS-ESS1-3) ESS1.B:  Earth and the Solar System ÔÇßKepler‚Äôs laws describe common features of the motions of orbiting objects, including their elliptical paths around the sun. Orbits may change due to the gravitational effects from, or collisions with, other objects in the solar system.  (HS-ESS1-4) ESS1.C:  The History of Planet Earth ÔÇßContinental rocks, which can be older than 4 billion years, are generally much older than the rock s of the ocean floor, which are less than 200 million years  old. (HS-ESS1-5) ÔÇßAlthough active geologic processes , such as plate tectonics and erosion , have destroyed or altered most of the very early rock record on Earth, other objects in the solar system , such as lunar rocks, asteroids, and meteorites , have changed little over billions of years. Studying these objects can provide information about Earth‚Äôs formation and early history. ( HS-ESS1-6) ESS2.B:   Plate Tectonics and Large -Scale System Interactions ÔÇßPlate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth‚Äôs surface and provides a framework for understanding itsCrosscutting Concepts Patterns ÔÇßEmpirical evidence is needed to identify patterns. ( HS-ESS1-5) Scale, Proportion, and Quantity ÔÇßThe significance of a phenomenon is dependent on the scale, proportion, and quantity at which it occurs. (HS-ESS1-1) ÔÇßAlgebraic thinking is used to examine scientific data and predict the effect of a change in one variable on  another (e.g., linear growth vs. exponential growth). (HS-ESS1-4) Energy and Matter ÔÇßEnergy cannot be created or destroyed ‚Äì only moved between one place and another place, between objects and/or fields, or between systems. (HS -ESS1-2) ÔÇßIn nuclear processes, atoms are not conserved, but the total number of protons plus neutrons is conserved.
