Within communities these differing identities, beliefs, and practices require change. The diversity of a community is not always represented/reflected by the majority. The following are aspects of identities, beliefs, and practices: ‚Ä¢Identities are who we are, the way we think about ourselves, and how we view the world. ‚Ä¢Beliefs are considered or accepted by individuals as true, and impact behaviors and reactions. ‚Ä¢Practices are the actual application of identities, beliefs, and ideas on real-world issues.

STANDARD 4 SOCIETIES EXPERIENCE CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME People and communities have aspects of continuity but experience some degree of change over time. Continuity refers to a society‚Äôs ability to hold on to what is important, to remain stable, anchored. Change refers to a society‚Äôs ability to adapt and make the adjustments necessary to protect and advance the society. The following are aspects of continuity and change: ‚Ä¢Change is generally continuous, not simply discrete events happening at their own pace, and are often determined by ‚Äúturning or tipping‚Äù points. ‚Ä¢Progress and regression are one of several ways of determining change. ‚Ä¢Continuity is the connection between events, ideas or beliefs over time.

KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS | Standard S 9 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov STANDARD 5 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PEOPLE, PLACES, IDEAS, AND ENVIRONMENTS ARE DYNAMIC. People, places, ideas, and environments experience change, activity, progress, or regression. All relationships are in a constant state of adjustment. These adjustments may also result in additional change, activity, progress, or regression. The following are aspects of dynamic relationship: ‚Ä¢Relationships are the interactions, connections, or feelings that exist between two or more parties and are characterized by constant change, activity, progress, or regression. ‚Ä¢The interaction of a single relationship between individuals, communities, and/or their environment impacts to some degree all other relationships. ‚Ä¢Dynamic relationships involve circumstances which often create shifts in priorities, leading to tension and adjustments toward progress.

History, Government, and Social Studies Best Practices Being an informed, thoughtful, and engaged citizen is reflected in a student‚Äôs ability to innovate, analyze complex problems, ask cogent questions, assemble and evaluate critical data, and seek creative solutions, going beyond the recall of factual information. None of us are born with this capability. We must go beyond simple recitation of foundational information and instead encourage the application of that information in authentic and realistic situations. Inquiry in social studies involves using information from a variety of sources and analyzing that information with increasingly sophisticated disciplinary strategies and tools. The following practices and expectations can assist teachers in the design of high-quality instructional lessons. Standard S | KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS 10 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov Effective HGSS Classroom Practices Include and Promote: Authentic Intellectual Work Effective classroom practices that promote learning in realistic situations and college, career, and citizenship-ready pathways have value beyond the classroom, engaging students in the construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and connection to the real-world. Civic Engagement Effective classroom practices promote students being informed, thoughtful and engaged citizens sharing their skills and knowledge through actions intended to improve their communities, state, nation, the world, and themselves. Culturally Relevant Instruction Effective classroom practices promote students recognizing and respecting the cultural and life experiences of each student, and using those experiences as resources for teaching and learning. Digital Literacy Effective classroom practices promote students using information and communication technologies to collect data, evaluate evidence, create products, and communicate effectively. These skills are powerful levers, allowing students to actively participate in civic society and contribute as informed, thoughtful, and engaged citizens. Students must also recognize the risks and responsibilities associated with the digital environment. Discipline-Specific Literacy within the Social Studies Effective classroom practices promote and support interacting with multiple types of primary and secondary evidence and media through the lens of the different social studies disciplines: history, economics, geography, civics. Reading at High Levels Effective classroom practices promote readers able to source, contextualize, corroborate, and read evidence closely. This includes the ability to determine meaning, main ideas, trustworthiness, and purpose in multiple types of evidence; decode discipline specific vocabulary and phrases; identify context, bias, and point of view when exploring evidence; evaluate authors‚Äô claims and their use of evidence, and analyze multiple texts for similarities and differences. Writing and Communicating Clearly and Coherently Effective classroom practices promote the ability to gather and synthesize multiple sources of information to make persuasive claims or arguments using evidence and reasoning; evaluate counter-arguments, explain events, relationships, or opinions; present information and analysis in textual and non-textual formats; revise and rewrite, and apply appropriate technologies and communication modes for specific purposes and audiences. Higher order thinking Effective classroom practices promote students grappling with content knowledge beyond remembering and understanding, to applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS | Standard S 11Inquiry-Based Instruction Inquiry-based Instruction/Learning allows students to be active learners by asking compelling questions, analyzing evidence, and reasoning to deepen their understanding of social studies content. By using an inquiry-based instruction approach, students practice being political scientists, historians, geographers, and economists. According to the C3 Framework1 there are four dimensions to the ‚ÄúInquiry Arc.‚Äù These four dimensions are: 1. Developing questions and planning inquiries 2. Applying disciplinary concepts and tools 3. Evaluating sources and using evidence 4. Communicating conclusions and taking informed action. Teaching through an inquiry-based instruction approach demands the skilled use of questions to frame units of study and to develop the necessary scaffolding so that even young children can examine issues of substance and interest Multiple Causes and Consequences Effective classroom practices promote students identifying, making a claim, and defending with evidence and argument, a variety of possible causes of events and consequences. These practices encourage appropriate decision-making, and help students understand the complexity of the various disciplines. Multiple Means of Communication Effective classroom practices promote students communicating relevant information through speaking, writing, and the creation of digital and print media. Multiple Perspectives and Disciplines Effective classroom practices promote students using multiple perspectives, points of view, and the principles of history, economics, civics, geography, and the humanities, and support a student‚Äôs ability to empathize, to develop alternative solutions to problems, and to self-assess their own positions. Research and Construction of Knowledge Effective classroom practices promote students being able to collect, organize, and evaluate information to construct an understanding of relevant evidence as it applies to a particular topic. These skills must include the use of both traditional and digital information and communication technologies. Social Emotional Learning and Character Development Effective classroom practices promote students‚Äô social-emotional learning and character development and should be integrated so that students will learn, practice, and model essential personal life habits that contribute to academic, social-emotional, and life success. Use of Primary and Secondary Sources Effective classroom practices promote students analyzing and interpreting a variety of different primary and secondary sources in traditional and digital formats, provides the opportunity for students to recognize the discipline‚Äôs subjective nature, to directly touch the lives of people in the past, and develop high level analytical skills. 1 C3 Teachers C3 Framework https://c3teachers.org/ Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov SuGGeSted Sco Pe and Se Quence | KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS 12 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov Suggested Scope and Sequence Kindergarten-12 classes should embed the disciplines of history, government, economics, geography and the humanities within each course. Teachers in kindergarten through fourth grade link content learning to a ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù Standard(s). The Focus Standard{hyperlink} allow teachers to set that standard as a theme around which social studies instruction at that grade-level takes place. As instruction progresses through grades K-4, teachers enforce previous learning around standards taught earlier while linking content learning to the Focus Standards at their grade-level. Refer to Instructional Guidance for the Elementary Classroom for daily time allotment recommendations on p. 9. Middle and high level courses should teach and reinforce all standards woven throughout the curriculum.

We want our students to develop the ability to use evidence, to solve problems, and to share solutions. But because the document also represents a departure from a more traditional instructional approach, it may be useful to make use of a structure outlining basic steps in high level lesson and unit design. START WITH STANDARDS The concepts embedded in the five Standards are intended to be applied across all disciplines and grade-levels. So, a Kindergarten student can access the idea that ‚ÄúChoices have consequences‚Äù while exploring building playground rules, while a high school student might examine the relationship between government policies and their impact on individual citizens. Educators should begin their unit design by selecting one standard that will focus and connect with the foundational content they wish students to uncover. Using the standard description and bulleted characteristics can help educators think of possible standard and content alignment. KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS | InStruct Iona l Ste PS for  HIG H-leVel lear nInG 15 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov SELECT CONTENT & CREATE QUESTIONS All great social studies instructional design begins with an engaging question or problem aligned to content which requires students to practice their critical thinking skills. A compelling question is the question that launches and guides an inquiry/investigation. It can be answered by more than one correct claim/thesis. The compelling question is central to Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs). Students‚Äô performances on completed CBAs are based on how well they understand and answer a question. The answer to a compelling question is dependent upon the correct use and analysis of primary and secondary sources. Compelling questions should be a blend between ‚Äúrigorous and relevant‚Äù (Grant et al., 2015, p. 2913) and should ignite student curiosity. Compelling questions can be created by educators or by students. The questions should not lead to an inhumane claim/thesis where students are defending an indefensible statement. But all lists include three characteristics: Questions should be focused on foundational content knowledge that is aligned to the standards. For example, the teacher of the upper level US History class wants students to understand that societies experience continuity and change over time (Standard Four) and that there are clear connections between the past and present (Benchmark Three). They decide to use the early 20th Century Progressive movement to help students understand that many current government policies and regulations can be traced back to the early 1900s. They develop the following question to engage the students and measure their knowledge: At which point should businesses run freely, and at which point should the government step in to protect workers and consumers? Social studies content is the vehicle for demonstrating ‚Äúmastery,‚Äù not the destination. Instructional design should find a balance between problem-solving, historical thinking/literacy skills, and student understanding of the foundational content, standards, and benchmarks. Do not treat the Content Outlines in the CBA Toolkit as a checklist of things that must be ‚Äúcovered,‚Äù‚Äì they are not state mandated nor do they act as a list of state assessment items. The appendices should act as a guide when districts plan curriculum and assist teachers in brainstorming lessons and units. Consider using this document along with staff expertise, personal experience, aligned learning resources, and local community values and interests to select appropriate instructional content and to develop lessons, units, questions, and assessment tasks that will lead to the future success of students. InStruct Iona l Ste PS for  HIG H-leVel lear nInG | KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS 16 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov DEVELOP TASKS WITH BENCHMARKS The Benchmarks are intended to provide concrete and measurable historical and creative thinking skills that students will demonstrate. They should be applied appropriately across all grade-levels and content areas. Notice the scaffolding of skills from Benchmark One to Four. Benchmarks can be used to brainstorm possible lesson or unit questions, tasks, and assessments. Consider using them to develop overarching and supporting questions, authentic problem, and assessment tasks. Assessment tasks should ask students to demonstrate the academic and cognitive skills identified in the benchmark (recognize, evaluate, analyze context, draw conclusions, investigate, make connections, make a claim, and support that claim with evidence and argument). Benchmark Three can be especially powerful as it asks students to investigate and connect past with present. Districts and classroom teachers should consider using this particular Benchmark to create relevant relationships for students. For example, middle-level US History students might be asked to uncover the relationships between early pre-civil war states‚Äô rights arguments and current government policies. CURATE RESOURCES Whether answering questions, solving problems, or supporting arguments, evidence is required. Instructional designs can and should include the use of a variety of primary and secondary sources for students to investigate. Instructional design requires the careful and intentional selection, collection, and organization of these types of online and print resources used by students. The skill of gathering useful online and hard copy evidence is a critical skill demonstrated by informed and knowledgeable citizens. This means educators must find the balance of providing necessary resources and training students to discover them independently. The US History teacher in the Progressive Movement example provides photographs by Lewis Hines and Jacob Riis as an introduction to the inquiry unit. They then introduce a contemporary account of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. As students progress through a series of supporting questions, the instructor guides them through a process of uncovering and evaluating a variety of additional resources. KANSAS HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS | InStruct Iona l Ste PS for  HIG H-leVel lear nInG 17 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov INTEGRATE READING & WRITING Social studies inquiry involves using a variety of sources and analyzing that information with increasingly sophisticated disciplinary strategies. As they progress through the grades, students should learn more advanced approaches related to generating responses to compelling questions using evidence and argument to support their claims. Students need these skills to become informed, thoughtful, and engaged citizens. So high-quality social studies instruction develops the reading, writing, and communication skills found in the Effective HGSS Classroom Practices Promote section of this document. These skills include evaluation, analysis, determining bias, and the development of products that communicate solutions. With guidance from their instructor, students studying the Progressive Movement interrogate two different texts: The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser. They ask questions about author, date, intent, and audience while exploring context and searching for supporting evidence. Students use their findings as part of their response to the unit‚Äôs compelling question.

History, government, economics, and geography are affected by human choice. Choices made by individuals and groups have consequences, and the desirability of the choices are dependent on the perceived positive and negative consequences. Often choices are built and dependent upon earlier choices and consequences. The following are aspects of choices and consequences: ‚Ä¢Human choices cause change dependent upon conditions which the decision maker may not be able to control or anticipate. ‚Ä¢Every choice comes with a cost. ‚Ä¢Human choice is affected by culture, geography, politics, economics, social emotional attachments, and other factors including other people. Benchmark: ‚Ä¢The student will recognize and evaluate significant choices and consequences that have impacted our lives and futures. ‚Ä¢The student will analyze the context and draw conclusions about choices and consequences . ‚Ä¢The student will investigate and connect examples of choices and consequences with contemporary issues . ‚Ä¢The student will use their understanding of choices and consequences  to make a claim or advance a thesis using evidence and argument. Instructional Best Practices Quality learning designs will connect disciplinary concepts and research-based best practices from history, economics, geography, civics, and the humanities and should include the practices listed below.

Students will study their personal environment (self, family, school, local, and tribal communities) and individual experiences with choices and consequences, and begin to develop empathy for others by being exposed to multiple perspectives, and recognize and evaluate choices to understand and analyze consequences. The standard and benchmarks center on inquiry-based instruction that includes thinking skills, historical processes, and primary and secondary sources so that students can apply their learning to their own lives. Instruction should connect these four social studies disciplines: history, economics, geography, and civics/government. Expanding on Past Learning and Skills Teachers draw on students‚Äô lived experiences, family unit composition, and individual cultural backgrounds to help students recognize and evaluate their connections to communities in order to develop their sense of self. Students should engage in understanding not only their own individual cultural backgrounds, but also begin to recognize and understand the backgrounds of others. Connecting with Future Learning and Skills First grade content focuses on the Roles of Individuals and the HGSS standard Individuals have rights and responsibilities . Students will study the role of individuals in various family and other social structures. The standard and benchmarks center on inquiry-based instruction that includes thinking skills, historical processes, primary and secondary sources, and content so that students can apply their learning to their own lives and understanding of classmates‚Äô lives. Instruction should connect these four social studies disciplines: history, economics, geography, and civics/government, including local, state, tribal, and federal governments. Culturally Relevant Pedagogy A vital part of the instructional design process is the integration of proven Culturally Relevant Pedagogy strategies. Incorporating the different backgrounds and experiences of students into classrooms ensures that students see themselves reflected in the curriculum. In teaching social studies, it is important to consider the existence of power dynamics among different groups of people, and how some perspectives have been favored over others across time and space. There is a need to explore diverse perspectives that reflect the diversity of our communities.  A pedagogy that acknowledges, responds to, and celebrates fundamental cultures, including their similarities and differences, offers full, equitable access to education for students from all cultures. The use of culturally relevant pedagogy also encourages critical thinking, as students analyze historical events and social issues through multiple cultural lenses. It empowers students to become active participants in their own education and develop a deeper understanding of the world around them. Suggested Units and Content Topics For the purpose of instruction, educators have great flexibility in how instructional content is organized. The units and topics listed below are provided as a planning guide and are not mandated. Understanding that there is overlap in some of these suggested units and content topics, instructors are encouraged to find parallels and connections across suggested units of study, creatively blending them whenever possible to increase relevance to students. 24 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov KInderGarten | APPENDICES The K-12 standards and benchmarks are designed to support a student‚Äôs ability to use social studies content in authentic ways. Thinking critically about content must be supported and taught in every grade level. Emphasis must be placed on the ‚Äúdoing‚Äù of social studies rather than simple acquisition of content knowledge. It is these skills that are assessed through the required Classroom Based Assessments, not simply the content itself. During their assessment years (4th, 7th, and high school), students complete the required KSDE Classroom-Based Assessment and 1) create a clear claim that answers a compelling question 2) using sourced evidence from multiple sources, and 3) use reasoning  that connects the evidence to their claim. History Unit  In this unit, students will study history through self-awareness and individual experience. They will examine how making choices to meet their daily needs at home and in school affects their lives. Students will recognize and evaluate how they are part of larger social, cultural, and/or tribal groups by analyzing their personal history, where they live, and how this changes over time. They will recognizesignificant Kansas events, symbols, and family customs. Suggested topics: technology, customs, symbols, social groups, cultural background, personal histories. Civics/Government Unit  In this unit, students will recognize the existence and importance of rules at home and at school. They will understand the role of authority figures at home and school and why they are needed. Students will recognize appropriate classroom behaviors and identify characteristics of a friend, a helpful classmate, and a leader. They will demonstrate an understanding of self-efficacy, assertiveness, and empathy.  They will recognize and demonstrate traits of being a good classroom citizen. Suggested topics: rules, leader/ship, partners, authority, conflict, collaboration, friends, classroom citizenship. Geography Unit  In this unit, students  will be introduce d to important geographic concepts and how to loca te major geographic features. Students will begin to identify human-made and natural environments of their local surroundings including home, school, neighborhood, and community. They will create mental maps to help them navigate their classroom and school settings. Students will be able to describeseasons in their area and how seasonal changes affect their daily lives. Suggested topics: location, directions, seasons, natural environment, human-made environment, home, school, neighborhood, community, Kansas, mapping. Econom ic Unit  In this unit, students will engage in purposeful and informed decision-making by consid ering risks and benefits to a decision. They will understand that people make choices because they cannot have everything they want. People earn money to pay for what they want and need. Students willrecognize needs are defined as those things that are necessary to live. They will understand that moneycan be used to purchase goods and services. Services are something one person does for someoneelse. Goods are something one can touch or hold. Students will recognize and evaluate the benefits ofsaving money and sharing resources. Suggested topics: economic decision-making, goods, services, wants, needs, money, earn, save, spend, resources, shared resources APPENDICES | FIRST GRADE 25 Kansas State Department of Education | www.ksde.gov first Grade ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS Focus Standard 2: Individuals have rights and responsibilities. (Educators will utilize other HGSS standards as necessary.) People and groups throughout history have deliberated the rights and responsibilities within their society. Rights are the basic freedoms of individuals while responsibilities view the collective obligations of people. The following are aspects of rights and responsibilities: yRights tell the bearer what they are at liberty to do, but are not a requirement to exercise them. yRights are something that societies often guarantee and come with responsibilities. yA responsibility is a duty or obligation to perform or complete. Benchmark: 1. The student will recognize and evaluate the rights and responsibilities of people living in societies. 2.
